# Traffic-Data-Boston
This project will look into trends in traffic accident data in Boston to pick up any trends that might occur and see which streets are the most dangerous.

Context:
There were a number of fatal accidents in and around Boston recently - with these cases in the limelight, the public will be curious to learn about what 
efforts the City is doing to make its streets safe. 

Under former Mayor Marty Walsh, Boston launched the "Vision Zero" program with the aim of eliminating fatal and serious traffic crashes in the city by 2030.

Key questions:
1) What is the most dangerous street?
2) What is the most dangerous month?
3) Which traffic acccidents occur most often?
4) What type of accident occurs most often?
5) How many of these accidents are fatal? 
6) How successful is the Zero Vision program?

1)
I began by submitting public record requests with the City of Boston for the following data: traffic crash  data over the past 5 years in Boston, 
including zones and streets, number of crashes, crash rate, speed limit, mph over, vehicle volume per street and crashes that result in an EMS response.

2) Analyze Boston also has a database (found using Dataset Search) with traffic accidents dating from 2015 with coordinates. A preliminary SQL analysis 
shows that traffic accidents had gradually increased up until 2019, but dipped in 2020/2021, most likely due to the pandemic. 

At this point, with the given data, I intend to conduct some geospatial analysis to see which areas in Boston are most dangerous for pedestrains.
